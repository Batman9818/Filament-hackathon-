# Ethereum (ETH)

## Type
Programmable blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency (ETH).

## Purpose
Enables building and deploying decentralized applications (dApps) through smart contracts.

## Key Features
- Turing-complete Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) allowing complex code execution.
- Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism (shifting to Proof-of-Stake in 2024).

## Common Use Cases
- DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
- NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)
- DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)

# Chainlink (LINK)

## Type
Decentralized oracle network.

## Purpose
Connects smart contracts on blockchains like Ethereum to secure off-chain data feeds and computations.

## Key Features
- Decentralized network of oracles to ensure data reliability and tamper-proof information.
- Aggregates data from various sources to minimize single point of failure.

## Common Use Cases
- Price feeds for DeFi applications
- Connecting smart contracts to real-world data (e.g., weather, flight information)

# Arbitrum (ARBI)

## Type
Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum.

## Purpose
Addresses Ethereum's scalability issues by processing transactions off-chain while inheriting security from the Ethereum blockchain.

## Key Features
- Optimistic Rollup technology for faster and cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum mainnet.
- EVM compatibility allowing developers to easily port existing Ethereum smart contracts.

## Common Use Cases
- Deploying dApps with high transaction volume and cost-sensitive requirements.
